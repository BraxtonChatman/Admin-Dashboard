# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a complete dashboard layout using CSS Grid as the main layout tool.
It replicates the structure of a typical admin panel, including:

- A sidebar with navigation and branding

- A header with a search bar, user information, and utility buttons

- A main content area displaying projects, announcements, and trending items

The focus of this assignment was on layout design rather than functionality, helping to strengthen understanding of grid-based page architecture.

# Features

- Modular grid layout for sidebar, header, and main content

- Nested grids for detailed internal alignment

- Customizable color palette, typography, and icons

- Semantic HTML for accessibility and maintainability

- Flexible sizing using fr units and minmax()
